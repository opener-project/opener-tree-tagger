Opener Tree Tagger
==================

This module implements a wrapper to process text with the PoS tagger
TreeTagger. TreeTagger is a tool that assigns the lemmas and part-of-speech
information to an input text.

This module takes KAF as input, with the token layer created (for instance by
one of our tokenizer modules) and outputs KAF with a new term layer. It is
important to note that the token layer in the input is not modified in the
output, so the program takes care of performing the correct matching between
the term and the token layer.

By default this module works for text in English, Dutch and German, but can be
easily extended to other languages. The language of the input KAF text has to
be specified through the attribute xml:lang in the main KAF element.

Initial version
----------------

This module has a dependency on the following external module: TreeTagger
(<http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/>) More
information is further down in this document.

Installation
------------

The TreeTagger module comes as a Ruby Gem and can be installed as following:

    gem install opener-tree-tagger

If you're using Bundler you can add this Gem to your Gemfile:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    gem 'opener-tree-tagger'

Then run `bundle install` to install the Gem.

Alternatively you can use `specific_install`:

    gem install specific_install
    gem specific_install opener-tree-tagger \
        -l https://github.com/opener-project/opener-tree-tagger.git

Finally you have to indicate to your program where TreeTagger is installed in
your machine, which is a requirement. If TreeTagger is not installed in your
machine you can download it from
<http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/> and follow the
installation instructions.

To indicate to our scripts where TreeTagger is
located, you have to set an environment variable with the location:

    export TREE_TAGGER_PATH=/usr/local/TreeTagger/

It is advised you add the path to the tree tagger in your bash or zsh profile
by adding it to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`.

Usage
-----

Once installed as a gem you can access the gem from anywhere. The input has to
be KAF format with the token layer created.

    cat input.token.kaf | opener-tree-tagger > output.token.term.kaf

In the file output.token.term.kaf we will have the KAF file extended with the
term layer (containing both lemma and PoS information).
